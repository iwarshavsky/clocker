**Clocker** is a web application day planner providing a new way to visualize your daily tasks. Instead of a traditional linear schedule, you can plan your day 24 hours ahead, in such a way you always know what you do a day from now. Traditional planners for a day start and end at midnight; but what if you're a night owl needing to plan in event from 23:00 to 3:00? Clocker makes no decisions when it comes to the structure of your day - you do you.

Techonologies used: primarily Javascript and SVG, PHP for backend.
