**Clocker** is a web application day planner providing a new way to visualize your daily tasks. Instead of a traditional linear schedule, you can plan your day 24 hours ahead, in such a way you always know what you do a day from now. Traditional planners for a day start and end at midnight; but what if you're a night owl needing to plan in event from 23:00 to 3:00? Clocker makes no decisions when it comes to the structure of your day. You are always focused on the present time and you have a circular view of the next 24 hours. You do you.
